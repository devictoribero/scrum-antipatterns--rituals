## SCRUM Rituals

🏁 Sprint Planning

🗣️ Daily Meeting

📝 Product Backlog Refinement

🎉 Sprint Review

🛡️ Retrospective

### 🏁 Sprint Planning

The Sprint planning is a time boxed working session that lasts roughly 1 hour for every week of a sprint. In sprint planning, the entire team agrees to complete a set of product backlog items. This agreement defines the sprint backlog and is based on the team’s velocity or capacity and the length of the sprint.

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- The team hasn't a clear Definition of Ready
- You think A is asked for but they asked for a B
- Setting unrealistic expectations
- Don't have a priorized backlog
- The Product Owner decides how much work
- Not notifying vacations or absences

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Set a Definition of Ready
- Ask as much as needed to have all details of what's asked for
- Break tasks into smaller ones. **Dicidi e vinci**
- Save capacity during the Sprint to check the complexity of the Next Sprint tasks
- Ask for a constant Product Backlog priorization.
- Be clear with your capacity
- Notify your vacations or absences so the capacity can be more accurate

### 🗣️ Daily Meeting

The Daily Meeting is normally time boxed to a maximum duration of 15 minutes, though this may need adjusting for larger teams. To keep the meeting short, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short, added to a "parking lot" list, and discussed in greater depth after the meeting, between the people affected by the issue.

Each member should answer the questions: _What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Is there anything blocking me?_

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- Off-topic conversations
- Technical conversations finding solutions
- Implementation details. **Alert!!**
- Reporting to the Product Owner
- Cross-conversations
- Monologs
- Cluelessness

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Encourage every one to interrupt if needed
- Cut things fast. Break wrong habits.
- Remain stand up so subconsciously the meeting will take less time
- Do we have to talk about something? **Do it later**
- Make a circle to combat the reporting symptom
- If a Team Member usually talks too much, time box each one
- Ask team members to prepare the Daily Meeting

### 📝 Product Backlog Refinement

The Product Backlog Refinement, also referred to as Product Backlog Grooming, is a method for keeping the backlog updated, clean and orderly.

It's a good time to clarify details and make tasks satisfy the Definition of Ready.

A good practice is to have 2 Sprints worth of work.

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- The tasks at the top of the Backlog have big estimations
- Tasks not estimated
- The Backlog contain items for longer than 2 month-ish
- The DEV Team is not challenging the Product Owner on which could be the best User Stories
- Long debates on each Product Item

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Use timers for each item, 5 minutes top. Give it an extra 3 min if everyone agrees
- Question Stick. Pass an object to your Team mates. Who has it have to ask for Product Item details
- Removed Product Items that have been longer than 2 month-ish
