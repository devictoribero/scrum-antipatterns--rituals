# scrum-antipatterns--rituals

The idea behind this repository is to explain the SCRUM Rituals and its most common anti-patterns and how to avoid them.

## SCRUM Rituals

- Sprint Planning
- Daily Meeting
- Backlog Refinement
- Sprint Review
- Retrospective

### Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is a time boxed working session that lasts roughly 1 hour for every week of a sprint. In sprint planning, the entire team agrees to complete a set of product backlog items. This agreement defines the sprint backlog and is based on the teamâ€™s velocity or capacity and the length of the sprint.

#### Bad Practices

- The team hasn't a clear Definition of Ready
- You think A is asked for but they asked for a B
- Setting unrealistic expectations
- Don't have a priorized backlog
- The Product Owner decides how much work
- Not notifying vacations or absences

#### Tips

- Set a Definition of Ready
- Ask as much as needed to have all details of what's asked for
- Break tasks into smaller ones. **Dicidi e vinci**
- Save capacity during the Sprint to check the complexity of the Next Sprint tasks
- Ask for a constant Product Backlog priorization.
- Be clear with your capacity
- Notify your vacations or absences so the capacity can be more accurate

### Daily Meeting

The Daily Meeting is normally time boxed to a maximum duration of 15 minutes, though this may need adjusting for larger teams. To keep the meeting short, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short, added to a "parking lot" list, and discussed in greater depth after the meeting, between the people affected by the issue.

Each member should answer the questions: _What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Is there anything blocking me?_

#### Bad Practices

- Off-topic conversations
- Technical conversations finding solutions
- Implementation details. **Alert!!**
- Reporting to the Product Owner
- Cross-conversations
- Monologs
- Cluelessness

#### Tips

- Encourage every one to interrupt if needed
- Cut things fast. Break wrong habits.
- Remain stand up so subconsciously the meeting will take less time
- Do we have to talk about something? **Do it later**
- Make a circle to combat the reporting symptom
- If a Team Member usually talks too much, time box each one
- Ask team members to prepare the Daily Meeting
