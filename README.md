# 🤷 Antipatterns of the Scrum Rituals

The idea behind this `repository` is to **explain the SCRUM Rituals and its most common anti-patterns and how to avoid them**. I did an [Introduction to Agile Presentation](https://slides.com/victorribero/practical_agile/fullscreen#/7/14 "Scrum rituals anti-patterns") wherepart of the things I explain, these are included. I hope you enjoy it. 🤗

## 🧙 SCRUM Rituals

As the [official guide of Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf "Download guide") says:

_Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum._
_These events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt._

🏁 Sprint Planning

🗣️ Daily Meeting

📝 Product Backlog Refinement

🎉 Sprint Review

🛡️ Retrospective

### 🏁 Sprint Planning

In the `Sprint planning` the `Team` decides what work will be done. _(`Product Backlog Items` known as `PBI`)_. This agreement defines the `Sprint Backlog` and is based on the team’s velocity or capacity and the length of the sprint. In the `Sprint planning` we'll answer the next question:

- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming `Sprint`?

It's important to remember that **only the DEV Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.**

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- The Team hasn't a clear `Definition of Ready`
- You think _A_ is asked for but they asked for a _B_
- Setting unrealistic expectations
- Don't have a priorized `Product Backlog`
- The `Product Owner` decides how much work
- Not notifying vacations or absences

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Set a `Definition of Ready`
- Ask as much as needed to have all details of what's asked for
- Break tasks into smaller ones. **Dicidi e vinci**
- Save capacity during the `Sprint` to check the complexity of the next `Sprint` tasks
- Ask for a constant `Product Backlog` priorization.
- Be clear with your capacity
- Notify your vacations or absences so the capacity can be more accurate

### 🗣️ Daily Meeting

The `Daily Meeting` is a maximum duration of 15 minutes meeting, though this may need adjusting for larger teams. To keep the meeting short, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short, added to a "parking lot" list, and discussed in greater depth after the meeting, between the people affected by the issue.

Each member should answer the questions: _What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Is there anything blocking me?_

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- Off-topic conversations
- Technical conversations finding solutions
- Implementation details. **Alert!!**
- Reporting to the `Product Owner`
- Cross-conversations
- Monologs
- Cluelessness

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Encourage every one to interrupt if needed
- Cut things fast. Break wrong habits.
- Remain stand up so subconsciously the meeting will take less time
- Do we have to talk about something? **Do it later**
- Make a circle to combat the reporting symptom
- If a Team Member usually talks too much, time box each one
- Ask team members to prepare the Daily Meeting

### 📝 Product Backlog Refinement

The `Product Backlog Refinement`, also referred to as `Product Backlog Grooming`, is a method for keeping the `Product Backlog` updated, clean and orderly.

It's a good time to clarify details and make tasks satisfy the `Definition of Ready`.

A good practice is to have 2 Sprints worth of work.

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- The tasks at the top of the `Backlog` have big estimations
- Tasks not estimated
- The `Product Backlog` contain items for longer than 2 month-ish
- The `DEV Team` is not challenging the `Product Owner` on which could be the best `User Stories`
- Long debates on each `Product Item`

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- **Use timers** for each item, 5 minutes top. Give it an extra 3 min if everyone agrees
- **Question Stick**. Pass an object to your Team mates. Who has it have to ask for Product Item details
- Remove `Product Items` that have been longer than 2 month-ish

### 🎉 Sprint Review

The `Sprint Review` is celebrated in order to inspect the `Product Increment` and adapt the `Product Backlog` if needed.
During the meeting, the `Scrum Team` explain to the `stakeholders` what has been accomplish, what hasn't and incidents or difficulties
the team had and how they did overcome them.

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- Selfish `Product Owner`. She/he says: I did
- Cheating. Showing development with bugs or not finished
- The `Team` doesn't explain challenges
- It's called or treated as a DEMO
- The `Product Owner` is presenting all the results, no one else talks on the `Team`

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Each `Team Member` should present their User Stories
- Everyone should explain challenges or problems
- Use timers to do not exceed the time
- The `Team` should **only present working software**

### 🛡️ Retrospective

The `Retrospective` is an opportunity for the `Team` to inspect itself and create a plan for the improvements with the actions derived from this meeting. The idea of the `Retrospective` is to discuss _what went well, what could be improved_ and _what will we commit to improve in the next sprint_.

#### 🙅 Bad Practices

- Taking as personals some comments
- A `Team Member` explains to an outsider what happens in the retrospectives
- The Actions are not assigned to anyone at the end of the `Retrospective` (no owners)
- Managers/outsiders are coming to the meeting
- The `Team` doesn't review past actions
- Discussion dominated by one or two people

#### 👨‍🏫 Tips

- Take `Retrospective` seriously
- Be honest with your workmates. Everyone should understand we are in the meeting to improve
- Encourage people to participate. Make everyone speak and give constructive feedback
- If there are no things to improve as a team, ask individually. _What would you help go faster? What don't you like?_
- To make the opinions more obvious, materialize them using post-it's or writing in a board
- Do the DOT Voting practice to decide which actions the team will do the next `Sprint`
- Assign owners to this actions
